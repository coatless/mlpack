Description: 'mlpack' is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written
             in C++, that aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of
             cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Note that 'mlpack' is
             licensed under 3-clause BSD, some reproductions of 'boost' source
             code inside 'mlpack' are licensed under Boost Software License 1,
             uses of 'stb' are licensed under MIT License and the Public Domain,
             'Ensmallen' is licensed under 3-clause BSD,
             'Armadillo' starting from 7.800.0 is licensed under Apache License 2,
             'RcppArmadillo' and 'RcppEnsmallen' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to
             'Armadillo' and 'Ensmallen' libraries) are
             licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later. Thus, 'mlpack' bindings
             for R are also licensed under similar terms. Note that
             'mlpack' requires a compiler that supports 'C++11',
             'Armadillo' 8.400 or later, and 'Ensmallen' 2.10.0 or later.
SystemRequirements: A C++11 compiler. Versions 4.8.*, 4.9.* or later of GCC
                    will be fine.
